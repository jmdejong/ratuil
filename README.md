# RATUIL

Responsive Ansicode Terminal User Interface Library

Ratuil a a Terminal UI library that was made for games that have the screen divided in multiple sections, and should support different (and changing) terminal sizes.
Another important feature is that the layout of the UI is generated from an XML file.

Ratuil was originally created with [Asciifarm](https://github.com/jmdejong/asciifarm) in mind.

There is currently no documentation yet. Take a look at game.xml and game.py to see how to use Ratuil.
